Datascience_Tableau
===================

Tableau assignment with D3JS.

Initially, this was an attempt to redo an assignment we had been asked to do in Tableau with d3. 
The goal was to rapidly generate charts by specifying properties in the way you would in Tableau. 
An initial study, only (I didn't spend more than 2 days on this). 

Of note though is the approach we toke to writing reusable charts. Each chart is in a separate class 
that inherits from a ChartBase class. Check it out.
